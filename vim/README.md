# LAPPIS: VIM_RC

----
# What is LAPPIS vimrc?

The first version of this vimrc, started at LAPPIS laboratory. However, one
day Seocam (one of the members of our lab) introduced us to his own .vimrc and
we tried to mixed his work with our work.

# Criteria

To install just run the install script:

```
$ ./install.sh
```

To get all features working properly make sure you change your terminal font
to ``hack`` (installed locally by the install.sh).

On iterm2 (OS X) I use ``Hack 12pt`` as regular font and ``Hack 16pt`` as
Non-ASCII fontt (both anti-aliased).

----
# In case of some problem:

Make sure you are using ``xterm-256color`` as your ``TERM``. You can do
that by adding the following line to your ``~/.bashrc``:

```
export TERM=xterm-256color
```
